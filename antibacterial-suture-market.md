<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antibacterial Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Suture</li><li>Non-Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antibacterial suture market encompasses two primary types: absorbable sutures and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to gradually break down in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal and reducing infection risk. In contrast, non-absorbable sutures remain intact for long periods and require surgical removal. Both types are enhanced with antibacterial properties to minimize the risk of surgical site infections, thereby improving patient outcomes and promoting faster healing in various surgical procedures.</p></p>
