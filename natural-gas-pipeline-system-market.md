<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Pipeline System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gathering Pipelines</li><li>Transportation Pipelines</li><li>Distribution Pipelines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The natural gas pipeline system market comprises three primary types: gathering pipelines, transportation pipelines, and distribution pipelines. Gathering pipelines collect raw natural gas from production sites and transport it to processing facilities. Transportation pipelines then move processed gas over long distances to storage or distribution centers. Finally, distribution pipelines deliver gas directly to end users, such as homes and businesses. Each segment plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient delivery of natural gas from production to consumption.</p></p>
